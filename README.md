The generate_dataset directory contains the code which creates a dataset and then separates that data into training and testing data.

In model1, we fit a linear function on the given data taking the loss function to be the mean absolute error.
The results (parameter theta) we obtain is : [2.13e-01 , 9.91e-01]

In model2, we fit a linear function on the given data taking the loss function to be the mean 'cubed absolute error'.
The results (parameter theta) we obtain is : [2.17e-01 , 9.93e-01]

In model3, we fit a quadratic function on the given data taking the loss function to be the mean of 'absolute error raised to the 4th power'.
The results (parameter theta) we obtain is : [4.467485630508033615e-12 , 9.178496652340738526e-01 , 9.996428984323879607e-01]
